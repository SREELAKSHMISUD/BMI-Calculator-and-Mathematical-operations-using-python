## Python Basics: Mathematical Operations and BMI Calculator
This repository contains Python programs demonstrating basic mathematical operations and a BMI Calculator.

## Description
This project covers the basic mathematical operations in Python and includes a BMI Calculator program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight and height.

## Mathematical Operations
In Python, mathematical operations follow the PEMDAS rule, which stands for:

Parentheses ()
Exponents **
Multiplication *
Division /
Addition +
Subtraction -
Multiplication and Division have the same priority, as do Addition and Subtraction. Operations with the same priority are performed from left to right.

## BMI Calculator
The BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in meters).
## Rounding Numbers and Floor Division
Python provides convenient methods to round numbers to a specific number of decimal places and perform floor division.
# Rounding:
round(number, ndigits) is used to round a number to a specified number of decimal places.
Example: round(8/3, 2) rounds the result of 8/3 to 2 decimal places, giving 2.67.
Example: round(2.666666666, 3) rounds the number to 3 decimal places, giving 2.667.
# Floor Division:

The // operator performs floor division, which divides and returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result.
Example: 8//3 performs floor division and returns 2.
# Using a Variable:

result = 4/2 assigns the value 2.0 to the variable result.
result /= 2 divides the value of result by 2, resulting in 1.0.
## Usage
To run the programs, you can use Replit or your local development environment:

Using Replit
Open Replit and create a new Python project.
Copy and paste the code into the Replit editor.
Click the "Run" button to execute the code.
